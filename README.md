Bash scripts for handling of ORCA input and output files. (More advanced numerical operations are often performed by python, in which case a *.py file is called), written with the Finnish Centre for Scienfific Cumputing's (CSC) HPC environment in mind.

The scripts are shared in hope that they might be useful. They are not part of an official software package and do not have official documentation. Brief instructions for usage have been written at the start of each bash script.
